</h1>

## Introduction 
This entertaining Hangman game app was created using React and Typescript. Players have up to 6 guesses to discover the hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a body part is revealed from head to leg. If the word remains unsolved after 6 guesses, the correct word is revealed. Give it a try and test your word-guessing skills! ðŸš€
